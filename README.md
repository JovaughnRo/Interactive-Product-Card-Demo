## What to expect from this Demo?
- Product cards presented in both single and dual-fuel power option interfaces.
- Responsive UI behavior: the card layout and information accessibility adapt based on screen size.
- An example of how jQuery dynamically generates specification tables for each equipment model and its family.
- A demonstration of how JSON and jQuery work together to drive the product card functionality.

## Technologies Used.

## Purpose
Marathon Equipment Inc. needed a user-friendly and responsive way to present complex equipment specifications.
The goal was to make technical data easy to navigate and support confident user decision-making across all devices.
This demo shows how I achieved that using modular JSON data and dynamic UI generation with jQuery.
